		<h2>Recommendations</h2>
		<p>Sorry, everyone! Since you're my captive audience for this assignment, that means I get to shill some of the wonderful online comics I've read and continue to read (one of my favorite pastimes). A good number of these are by Finnish artists as well!</p>

			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://killsixbilliondemons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kill Six Billion Demons</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>An ordinary woman is thrown into a sprawling and unforgiving world, with a key lodged in her forehead that means unfathomable power and danger alike. Incredible art, worldbuilding, and writing; in less formal terms, it goes hard as hell at all times. Heads up: lots of violence.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.tigertigercomic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiger, Tiger</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>"A young noble lady steals her brother's identity and his ship to find love and adventure, and to write a book […] about the fascinating life cycle of sea sponges!" Funny, fascinating, and thrilling, with gorgeous art and one of my favorite monsters ever. The creator is Finnish!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://sssscomic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stand Still, Stay Silent</a></td>
				<td>Completed</td>
				<td>90 years after a mysterious illness nearly wipes out humanity, one small, ragtag, and incredibly underfunded team becomes the first to head into the "Silent World", where trolls and giants of old have returned in new form. Post-apocalyptic setting meets Nordic myth in one of my favorite setups ever. <b>Insane</b> monster designs. Also by a Finnish creator! Heads up for body horror.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.bicycleboy.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bicycle Boy</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>An amnesiac cyborg wakes up to the aftermath of a massacre and only keeps getting himself into deeper and deeper trouble from there. Takes place in a post nuclear wasteland: think Fallout or Mad Max*, though this setting and story are very much their own. Stellar writing and visuals; I especially love how creative the paneling gets later on. The creator also has a new comic called The Dancing Bones that's pretty great so far! Heads up for lots of blood and violence.
				<br><i>*not actually post-nuclear, but the visual comparison stands.</i></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.theglassscientists.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Glass Scientists</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>Dr. Jekyll is the genteel leader of a society of mad scientists; he is both the man who can do it all and the man who teeters on a fraying tightrope. A gaslamp fantasy take on 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' that does great things with themes of repression, societal pressures, acceptance, and more.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.sleeplessdomain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleepless Domain</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>Magical girl Undine is one of many who protect the city from nightly surges of monsters, but the threat of loss–and worse–soon comes to call. A fascinating, nuanced take on magical girls, and just a great story, period!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.thewitchdoor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Witch Door</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>Two neighbors find themselves in the unique position of being able to help each other with their respective problems, though one comes with connections to a world of magic. Another comic by a Finnish creator!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></td>
				<td>Ongoing</td>
				<td>An unusual girl at an unusual school triggers events of an unfathomable scale with just one act. A sprawling story in terms of cast and plot, and masterfully done.</td>
			</tr>
